# d3-playground
a playground for me to write D3 dataviz code

I want to:
- take interesting data that relates to current events and build visualizations to tell a story or explore alternative meanings
- play with different ways of showing live disc golf scores along with final results for a round or tournament
- play with different ways of presenting multivariate data as part of profile visualizations
